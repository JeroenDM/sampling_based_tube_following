# Sampling-based Tube Following for Redundant Robotic Manipulators
This repository contains python scripts to recreate the simulation results and figures of the research paper `Sampling-based Tube Following for Redundant Robotic Manipulators`.

## Requirements to run scripts

### Python 3.6
The scripts are testen using Python 3.6. The easiest way to get all the required libraries is installing the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for Python 3. The only non-standard libraries, appart from `ppr` discussed below, are [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) which are included in Anaconda.

### Planar Python Robotics (ppr)
The path planning algorithms are written in a custom made software framework for planar robotics. I'm trying to setup the package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ppr/) but I'm having some diffuculties with the C++ code for the moment. The good news is that you can just download the repository and use the package without bothering to install anything.

1) Download the repository [here](https://gitlab.mech.kuleuven.be/u0100037/planar_python_robotics/tags). For the results in the paper I used version `0.1.2`.
2) Unzip the file somewhere you can remember. You need the path later on!

(The gilab download icon, located on the right of the version description, looks like this:
![gitlab_download_icon](figure/gitlab_download_icon.png))

In order the use the `ppr` package, you need to add the location to the path, which is done in the python scripts. There is nice template code in the two scripts using the package (`utility.py` and `plot_figure_4.py`).

```python
from sys import path
path.append(r"/home/jeroen/Documents/gitlab/planar_python_robotics")
```

Here you change the string `/home/jeroen/Documents/gitlab/planar_python_robotics` to where you put the unzipped folder.
(In the best version of the future, this will not be necessary anymore and you can just intall the package using `pip install ppr`. But where not there yet. Although the present is also pretty good, as the sun is shining outside when I'm typing this.)

## Running the scripts

The scripts starting with `plot_` are for, you guessed it, plotting stuff. The default figures are already in the folder `figure/`. Other scripts run simulations and save the data in the folder `data`. A special case is the script `fixed_sampling.py`, which used the table template to generate `table_1.tex`. I made a figure showing how scripts and data files are related.
